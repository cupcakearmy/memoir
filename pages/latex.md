# LaTeX

This is a collection of different LaTeX snippets for different use-cases.

## Building

I exclusively [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) as build engine, as it is a modern alternative to the "OGs".
Most importantly, it supports lazy loading of dependencies, so the install size is tiny (in comparison).

## Pipeline

To build Latex in a GitHub Action, see [here](dev_ops/github-actions/latex)
